# Git Practice
A simple project to practice a few git/github workflows.  Replace the contents of this file with the contents indicated in the [instructions](./instructions.md).

Below is an article talking about some [statistics](https://radixweb.com/blog/software-development-statistics) of software engineering. It helps us to get a better understanding of software engineering industry. 

## Most Popular Programming Language ##
It is surprising to me that JavaScript is the most popular programming language in 2024, with 22.5 million developers globally. And Python ranks second with 9 million active developers, followed by Java in third place with 8.2 million developers. 

These statistics highlight the growing importance of JavaScript, especially in web and software development, while Python's simplicity and versatility continue to attract new developers. I do understand why Python and Java is popular. But as a person that only use Javascript in the Web design class, I don't quite understand its popularity. For me, **JAVA** is the **Best** language!!!

## Github & Software Engineering ##
The widespread use of open-source code is evident, with 97% of applications incorporating it. GitHub, a leading platform for software development, now hosts 94 million developers and over 85.7 million new repositories. In 2023, GitHub saw a 38% increase in private projects, accounting for more than 80% of overall activity on the platform, setting the stage for continued growth in 2024. GitHub plays a critical role in software engineering / development. I just can't imagine the world without Github. It binds all coders and programmers together.
